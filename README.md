# Appicoders Landing - Vite + React + Tailwind (Starter)

This repository is a pixel-ready starter for the Figma design you shared.
Because automated access to the Figma file was blocked, assets are left as placeholders.

## What you get
- Vite + React project (minimal) with Tailwind configured.
- Components: Navbar, Hero, Features, Footer.
- `src/assets/` folder for you to drop exported assets from Figma.
- `src/constants.js` maps expected asset filenames — update it if you change names.
- `assets/README.md` contains instructions to export from Figma.

## How to finish (pixel-perfect)
1. Export assets from Figma:
   - Select the layers or groups you want.
   - In the right-hand panel choose Export → PNG or SVG.
   - Export at 1x (or 2x for retina) and save files.
2. Put exported files into `src/assets/` and name them:
   - `logo.svg`, `hero-illustration.png`, `feature-1.png`, `feature-2.png`, `feature-3.png`
3. If the Figma uses custom fonts:
   - Download the fonts and add them to `public/fonts` or import via Google Fonts in `index.html`
   - Update `index.css` to use the fonts.
4. Run locally:
   - `npm install`
   - `npm run dev`

## Notes about "Made by AI"
All code is written to feel handcrafted and maintainable. Rename or refactor class names if you want a different convention.

If you want, upload the exported assets here and I will re-run and embed them into the project and produce a final zip optimized for pixel accuracy.
